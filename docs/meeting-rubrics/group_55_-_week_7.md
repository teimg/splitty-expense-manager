#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Good & chosen beforehand!


#### Agenda 
_Good_

GOod agenda, follows the template well. It is fine to add some custom points on issues the team experienced over the past week. E.g. a bug that is not solved yet or discussion about a certain implementation.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very Good_

Clear and detailed. Agenda item 4 and summarize action point is basisaclly the same, try to combine that into 1 list of bullet points of tasks.


#### Chair performance
_Good_

Good that the chair leads the discussions and says when to move on to the next action point. Try to make clear conclusions after a discussion so the minute taker can also clearly note that down, instead of moving on or letting the discussion dwindle.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very good_

Good discussions about bugs/issues with synchronization! Making sure everyone is on the same page with these kinds of issues is usefull to make sure they are resolved. Overall meeting is very good, keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

Alot of polishing and some improvements from last week! Some final features like email notification, settlement of debts, JSON dumps still need to finished. Keep it up these final weeks, you are well on track to deliver a good final application!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_good_

Disucssing the action points of the previous week was nice to see. Here you can also discuss the workload you exprienced and divide the new issues differently based on that. Sometimes people are taking a little less initiative during the meeting/discussions, try to participate even if you are not asked anything directly.
