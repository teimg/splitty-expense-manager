Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Different and chosen beforehand!

#### Agenda 
_Very good_

Clear agenda, however I am missing the sprint retrospective/planning.

For the retrospective: Look at all the action points that are in the minutes of the previous meeting. Discuss for each action point if it was completed or not.
For the sprint planning: Here you will divide tasks: e.g. person x will implement the admin page login by date y. The "summarize action points" section will summarize all the divided tasks, and the minute taker will clearly write the "Who , what , when?" You are doing this very well, which is good to see, just rename the point to "Sprint planning" to make it clear for me/course staff.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Insufficient_

Good minutes for the regular points! However the "Summarize action points" is lacking. I scored insufficient here, as I would like to see for every person a clear summarization of when/what tasks they will they complete in the coming sprint (week).


#### Chair performance
_Sufficient_

All topics were covered, however sometimes the chair could have taken the lead sooner by moving on to the next point.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

I liked the meeting and it was very constructive on what features need to be implemented and who will implement them. Sometimes people were not fully paying attention so try to listen to everyone speaking.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very well_

Can create events, invite people, edit and server communication is working. Expenses can also be created and edited. Language feature switching is also working. You are well on track to have a finished application, and you are slighly ahead of other groups, so keep it up!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

You shortly went over the sprint retrospective, try to spend some more time doing this. It is indeed good to divide front/end tasks arbitrarily, and it up to each person to make sure they will cover both.
