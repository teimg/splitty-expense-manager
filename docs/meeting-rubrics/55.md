#### 1) Self-organization
_Sufficient_

The team was in charge, but sometimes there were no clear discussions during the meeting. The tone was friendly and repsectful which was good to see!

#### 2) Suggested Topics
_Sufficient_

Not all topics mentioned in the lecture on Monday were covered, having an agenda next week will help. (Read the teamwork document on Brightspace!)
