#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Good that there is a chair and minute taker chosen beforehand!


#### Agenda 
_Sufficient_

The agenda contains good points, however make sure to check if it fits in a 45minute meeting. There are alot of "?" for time estimation, it is better to estimate at least something. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Not applicable_


#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

Very nice that you summarized the agenda before the meeting. The topics were covered well and the discussions were well managed! Time management could be improve to make sure the entire agenda can be covered. The meeting should be done at 16:30.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Sufficient_

The team took good ownership of the meeting and there were contrsuctive discussions. However some people were not equally participating in the meeting, make sure everyone is involved (e.g doing something else or not giving opinions)!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You showed the current state of the application, which still was the demo project. Because there were no changes yet, I can't give feedback on this point yet. I only gave "sufficient" here as you did not add anything to the demo.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Good_

I think you will be well on track to equally divide tasks and features. Next week, when discussing if/what the action points of the previous week are completed, I will be able to give more feedback!
