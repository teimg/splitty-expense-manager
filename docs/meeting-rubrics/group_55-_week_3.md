#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Clear minute taker and chair in agenda and mentioned before the meeting.

#### Agenda 
_Very good_

Agenda looks really good, follows the template and was added in time. A small tip would be to add the action points of the previous week in the agenda, so you can clearly discus those action points and see if they were completed or not.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very good_

The minutes were merged into the agenda file, and are clear and consise. The fact you added deadlines to the tasks is nice! A small but minor improvement could be making the minutes more readable.


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

The chair led the meeting very well, make sure the agenda points were covered in reasonable time. Also made sure everyone was equally participating by asking others for their opinion when they were a little quieter.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Good_

Everyone was friendly and constructive. Not everyone was equally participating in meetings, like doing other things on your laptop or not contributing during disucssions. Also make sure to conretely divide and assign the tasks for next week besides discussing doing the endpoints.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Excellent_

You presented the application as per the agenda, the application is runnable and there are considerable changes compared to previous week. I think you are perfectly on track and thus I give excellent here. Keep up the good work!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

You talked about the action points last week quickly, try to give a tiny bit more attention to discussing them next week. Otherwise I feel like you reached the goals and everyone is contributing to the team! Also make sure to conretely divide and assign the tasks for next week besides discussing them.
