Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chosen beforehand and different people!

#### Agenda 
_Very good_

Looks good and contains all needed points. Make sure to put down a time estimate for all points, even if you are unsure. Really good that you spend some time on last week and what went wrong/went right.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

Some sections have good notes, like "Our next steps: what functionality should we focus on next?" However "Agenda - item 5: Division of tasks" is not clear who needs to do what. Make it more clear by writing it like "person x: do task Y by deadline Z". This way is somebody reads the notes on a later date can easily see their tasks.


#### Chair performance
_Good_

Really nice to see the chair ask everyone for their opinion on feedback of the past week. It is perfectly fine to cut coversations short if you notice that is is not contributing to the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation
_good_

Was a good meeting, however not everyone is equally participating. Make sure to involve people who are less active. This can be done by explicitly asking them what they think about problem X or talking point Y.

#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Good_

You presented the application and there was good progress from last week. The language switching feature and frondtend screens look good, together with the server endpoints. Make sure to get some basic client-server communication working to be on track!

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

You achieved the actions of the previous week. However I am not sure everyone is equally aware of the current state of the application. It is fine to ask somebody if they are on track or if anyone could help them.
