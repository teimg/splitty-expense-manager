Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Different and chosen beforehand!

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Perfect, follows the template, is on time and has good sprint review/planning! Try to note down the correct chair :)

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Excellent_

Clear and good notes! They contain the reason _why_ something happened, which is very nice to see when reading the notes back on a later date.

#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

The chair went through the points very well, and made sure conclusions were made! Also involving less active team members was nice to see. Only imrpovement could be that you don't need to take notes during the meeting, you can ask the minute taker to do that. It is fine to ask the minute taker to read back some notes, so you don't need to take any yourself.

#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

Good meeting, constructive and friendly. Sometimes people were doing something else/not paying attention, try to all listen to each other.

#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

You showed the main branch, popups are now working, email notifcations and the admin page. Some final basic requirements still need to be finished, try to do that this week! Otheriwse you are on track to have a good final application.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Good_

Most of the tasks seem to be well divided in terms of workload. The action points of the previous week were also completed well. If you notice some team members not actively taking enough issues upon themselves, be honest and let them know.
